					<p><b>Building a Sustainable Future (2017 to Present)</b>
The industry shift toward eco-friendly vehicles represents a significant opportunity for Hanon Systems. With its sharp focus on accelerating growth, enterprise excellence and a customer-focused mindset to deliver shareholder value, Hanon Systems continues to see its business grow, particularly in solutions for electrified vehicles. With an eye on the future, the company remains diligently focused on implementing continuous improvement actions to achieve operational excellence and delivering eco-friendly automotive thermal and energy management solutions. In 2018, the company continued to be acknowledged for its efforts and achievements. Hanon Systems was named GM Supplier of the Year and to the Ford Aligned Business Framework, the automaker’s network of strategic suppliers. The company also was recognized by FCA for quality excellence at its Canada operations and announced its intent to acquire the fluid pressure and controls business of Magna International. In 2017, the company earned numerous customer and industry accolades including the coveted Ford World Excellence Award and the “Best Product Development Partner” award from Hyundai Motor Group.

					<p><b>New Beginnings (2014 to 2016)</b>
The newly consolidated businesses that became HVCC launched the birth of a global powerhouse in the automotive climate sector. What were two companies became one, and the importance of leveraging operational synergies and building a sustainable framework was center-stage. The company focused on its glide path to build shareholder value and sustainable growth, and in late-2014 completed the acquisition of the thermal and emissions business from Cooper Standard. This new business laid a solid foundation to help the company further grow its know-how and automotive business in fuel-efficient thermal management solutions and modules. That same year Visteon Corp. announced its intention to sell its equity stake in HVCC. That deal was complete in mid-2015 when Hahn & Co. Auto Holdings became the majority shareholder and the company’s name changed to Hanon Systems. In 2016, the company celebrated its 30th anniversary. It also was named to Forbes Asia list of top companies in Asia; and received the IR52 Jang Young-Shil for its triple-zone HVAC and two New Excellent Technology (NET) certificates: for its deodorizing air conditioning technology and centrifugal air compressor.</p>

					<p><b>Building on a Strong Reputation (2011 to 2013)</b>>

In 2011, HCC’s Turkey operation in Gebze was awarded the quality 5-star certification from Hyundai-Kia Motor Company (HKMC); and the company received the Green Management Award in Korea supporting its commitment to developing eco-friendly solutions and environmental manufacturing that same year.
