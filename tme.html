					<p><h2>Battery Thermal Management System<br><br><img src="tme1.png"></h2>
						The prevailing technology to meet the power demand of electric vehicles is the lithium-ion (li-ion) battery and, for more than 10 years, Hanon Systems has manufactured battery thermal management systems. Utilizing vehicle and system expertise, Hanon Systems has developed components that can be applied in various system architectures to meet a wide array of customer requirements. The battery chiller is a compact plate-to-plate heat exchanger that transfers thermal energy from the battery coolant loop to the vehicleâ€™s refrigerant loop to maintain optimum battery temperatures. The battery contact heat exchanger is packaged in the battery pack to transfer thermal energy between the battery pack and a coolant or refrigerant loop. It provides precise temperature control, specifically in lithium ion battery applications, and the fluid circuitry delivers uniform cell cooling and heating for improved battery performance and durability.<br><br><br><br>
						<h2>Heat Pump System<br><br><br><img src="tme2.png"></h2><br>The heat pump system is a solution to heating electric, hybrid and internal combustion engine vehicles where there is insufficient waste heat for cabin heating. Redirection of the refrigerant via valves allows cooling of the vehicle using the same system components. The system can extend the driving range of environmentally-friendly electric vehicles because it can cool and heat the vehicle using a minimum amount of energy.<br><br><br>

						<h2>High Voltage Cooling Fan Motor<br><br><br><img src="tme3.png"></h2><br>
						The high voltage cooling fan motor incorporates a brushless DC motor offering high efficiency and reliability in fuel cell electric vehicle applications. Its high speed, high power design received a New Excellent Technology (NET) from the Ministry of Knowledge Economy in 2012, and is the world's first device that allows quietness and high efficiency by combining a motor and an inverter, resulting in low power consumption and light weight.

					<p><h2>Centrifugal Air Compressor<br><br><img src="tme4.png"></h2>
						The centrifugal air compressor is a turbo blower for fuel cell electric vehicles that generates electricity by supplying oxygen to the stack of a fuel cell. It mainly compresses air to a set pressure and flow rate, and includes a brushless DC motor designed to rotate the compressor smoothly and at high speed. By using an impeller type propeller and brushless DC motor, high aerodynamic performance and efficiency is achieved.<br><br><br><br>

						<h2>E-Compressor<br><br><img src="tme6.png"></h2>
						For traditional internal combustion vehicles, the air conditioning compressor is driven by a belt connected to the engine; therefore, it can only operate when the engine is running. Electric and hybrid vehicles operate under different conditions that preclude conventional compressor designs. The state-of-the-art design includes an efficient scroll compressor controlled by an on-board electric motor and integrated power electronics. The electric compressor operates independently, enabling the cabin to be cooled even when the engine is off. Its compact design fits within the traditional belt-driven compressor package space, minimizing vehicle complexity in platforms that offer hybrid-electric model variants.<br><br><br><br>
